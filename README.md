Santa's Grotto is an interavtive scene created in Unity, with heavy focus on the lighting and sound aspects of the scene in order to hit marks on the rubric. it allows a user to explore a foreign winterwonderland, with the use of NCPs to create a more realistic experience including Santa standing outside his grotto. it also includes interactable features with the use of C# scripting including a functioning radio and a lightswitch that turns the lights in the grotto on and off.
